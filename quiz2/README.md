For the coding part of this quiz. I extended the functionalities of my lab8. Besides being able to load labs and lectures, the website now also supports MBE lectures as well as being able to be archived and removed along with Websys materials. To accomplish the functionality specified--a button, when clicked switches to another course--I created a function to randomly generate a number up to the length of the total number of course content and call the show function with those arguments.
