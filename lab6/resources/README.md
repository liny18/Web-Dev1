(1)To increase the website's usability, I removed the navigation bar which serves no purpose since the lab is only focused on the play page rather than the entire webapp. Instead, I moved the Dark/Light mode switch and the request dictionary changes link to where the navigation bar once was. (2)This helps with the website's findability since these are two important features and putting them at the top of the website makes them much easier to be seen by the users. (3)I also did other style changes such as adding borders to make the scores stand out, making the buttons bigger and prettier, grouping items together using flexboxes, adding hover effect to buttons, etc. To increase performance, (4)I got rid of excessive HTML elements, CSS selectors and Javascript code. (5)Instead of having the Javascript load in the combs, I used CSS to statically put them on the page. I also used variables to store DOM elements so they don't need to get called over and over again. To further optimize the webpage, (6)I separated CSS and Javascript to individual files, and lastly, (7)minified both files.
