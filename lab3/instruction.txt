Lab 3

Due 10/7 before you walk in the door

Have you seen the ITWS web page? It’s not very good… https://science.rpi.edu/itws/
Your job this week (as individuals, this is not a group lab) is to make us a new site.

Features
The site should have the following features:
Information about the ITWS program
Undergrad major
Undergrad minor
Grad
Information about the core faculty (me, Prof. Plotka, Prof. Thilanka, Dr. Fontaine, Dr. Stewart)
Links to our social media presence (TikTok: ITWSatRPI, Twitter: rpi_itws, Facebook, our blog: https://itwsatrpi.blogspot.com/, LinkedIn ITWS group)
At least 5 interesting news items (this can be static content)
A way to contact us: e.g., a form that sends something to an email address 
(don’t use anyone’s email address without asking them first! – when in doubt, use a fake email address)
The site need not be mobile, but if you’re going to use Bootstrap, that will likely happen anyway. 
You are free to check the mobile site and tell us about it in your README.md file and that will get filed under creativity.
You need not use jQuery (you can if you’d like) but you must use JavaScript.
Make the site catchy. Something we would actually want to replace our current site with (and hey, maybe we will!)
This site can be all one page or multiple pages, up to you!
This week’s lab is to see how well you use HTML/CSS/JS together to make well-presented pages. 
So feel free to use whatever you’d like to showcase that.

Please serve this lab at the following URL: http://<your-personal-vm>/<your-personal-lab-repo>/lab3
This should be the default URL if you make a new folder in your personal repo named lab3 and 
then clone your personal repo into your /var/www/html directory.
