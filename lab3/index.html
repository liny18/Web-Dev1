                <p>Rensselaer Professor Lirong Xia Named One of “AI’s 10 to Watch”</p>
                <section class="news-popup" id="news1">
                    <h2>Rensselaer Professor Lirong Xia Named One of “AI’s 10 to Watch”</h2>
                    <p>Lirong Xia, a computer scientist whose research focuses on “social choice” – the analysis of individual preferences used to reach collective decisions or social objectives – has been recognized by IEEE Intelligent Systems magazine as one of “AI’s 10 to Watch.”

                        According to IEEE Intelligent Systems, a publication of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the biennial honor is intended to acknowledge and celebrate 10 young scientists in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and to promote cutting-edge research among next-generation researchers, industry, and the general public alike.
                        
                        Chuck Stewart, head of the Department of Computer Science, congratulated Xia, who joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2013.
                        
                        “This award highlights Lirong’s great early success and his outstanding potential, and we congratulate him on this recognition,” Stewart said. “Professor Xia joins Heng Ji – a young expert in natural language processing – as the second Rensselaer recipient of this award, reflecting the high quality of AI researchers who have joined the department in recent years.”
                        
                        Xia’s research combines principles and techniques of economics, statistics, and AI to help a group of agents resolve disputes and make joint decisions. For example, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) wants to rank movies by aggregating user ratings, which represent subjective preferences and can be viewed as data generated by a statistical model – how should IMDb design its ranking mechanism? An ideal system will produce accurate rankings and recommendations with minimal input, but such a system presents many challenges. For example, recommendations are only accurate if they match the preferences of the user. And systems must also contend with the strategic behavior of users who, for example, deliberately enter a ranking either more positive or negative than their true opinion in order to sway the overall ranking of a product in one direction or another.
                        
                        IEEE Intelligent Systems began the process of selecting recipients in early 2015 by soliciting nominations from a wide range of senior AI researchers from both academia and industry. The nominees all received their Ph.D.s in the past five years. A short list of top candidates was voted on by the selection #committee, consisting of members of the Intelligent Systems editorial and advisory boards. The “AI’s 10 to Watch” were recognized in the January/February 2016 edition of IEEE Intelligent Systems.
                        
                        Having served on the selection #committee for the award in previous years, James Hendler, director of the Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA) and Tetherless World Professor of Computer, Web, and Cognitive Sciences at Rensselaer, said he could attest to the difficulty of the decision and the weight of the honor.
                        
                        "This award is one of the top awards given to young scientists in the AI field,” Hendler said. “Started 10 years ago, the award is given to researchers who are clearly having strong impact within the first few years after their thesis.  Nominations are sought from department chairs, fellows of professional organizations, and others, and the field is global. Only the best are chosen.”
                        
                        Xia’s research exemplifies the work being done at The New Polytechnic, addressing difficult and complex global challenges, the need for interdisciplinary and true collaboration, and the use of the latest tools and technologies, many of which are developed at Rensselaer.
                        
                        Xia is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rensselaer. Prior to joining Rensselaer in 2013, he was a National Science Foundation Computing Innovation Fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University. Xia received a Ph.D. in computer science from Duke University. He is an associate editor of Mathematical Social Sciences and is on the editorial board of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. Xia is the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER award, and a Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship for the Economics and Computation Program.</p>

                        Toward IoT – A Framework for Data Analytics on Digital Device Networks
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The Internet of Things promises to improve our lives by connecting sensors in the objects that surround us – buildings, appliances, gadgets, and vehicles – and the data that they collect. But to realize that potential, programmers need tools that make it easier to create applications that combine devices and the cloud. With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF), researcher Stacy Patterson is building those tools and developing a framework that developers can use to easily perform data analytics over a multitude of devices.

                        “Rather than developers designing custom algorithms for each network of devices, we’re going to build a framework of software that sits on all these devices and the cloud that will automatically manage communication between the devices and deal with device and network failures,” said Patterson, the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). “Now the developer only needs to provide a little bit of code to say ‘this is how I want it to work,’ and this framework will take care of the rest.”

                        The project, “Toward a Machine Learning Framework for the Internet of Things,” is supported by a prestigious five-year $618,661 NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award (CAREER).

                        “Dr. Patterson is developing approaches that advance the vision of Internet of Things technology,” said Curt Breneman, dean of the Rensselaer School of Science. “This CAREER award recognizes the promise of that work, and we congratulate her for it.”

                        Patterson’s research epitomizes the work being done at The New Polytechnic, addressing difficult and complex global challenges, the need for interdisciplinarity and true collaboration, and the use of the latest tools and technologies, many of which are developed at Rensselaer.

                        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of devices, from RFID tags, to smart thermostats, to light bulbs, that can sense and communicate information. It is predicted that, by 2020, there will be 25 to 50 billion IoT devices. This massive network and the data it generates will enable new applications in a wide range of critical domains including environmental management, smart infrastructure, and health care.

                        The project is an extension of Patterson’s current research into enhancing the utility of sensors embedded in automobiles, by creating real-time networks that allow automobiles to pool their individual information into a larger shared picture of driving conditions in the area.

                        To achieve the vision of IoT, as well as in her work with automobile networks, Patterson said, it is crucial to be able to quickly analyze and learn from the massive amount of generated data. Current approaches for big data analytics require full data transfer to a platform with large computational power, such as the cloud. Given the projected explosion in the number of devices and the resulting data generation rate, this is not feasible.

                        Patterson said the grant will help her achieve three goals in IoT research. The first is to develop a computational framework that reduces the problem to an abstraction, anticipating considerations like the type and quality of data, the number of devices, and how the data are related across devices.

                        “What kinds of relationships are people interested in with this data, and how does that embed down to the physical world?” Patterson said. “This is ultimately about searching for a pattern in how I would solve the kinds of problems that interest people.”

                        The second goal is to provide a stable platform that masks the differences between devices, and compensates for failed devices or computers and lost data. Finally, she will build tools to enforce a standard for speed and accuracy of the framework.

                        Driving Conditions According to Cars and the Cloud
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        About 1.3 million vehicles are involved in weather-related accidents each year. Cars are increasingly equipped with sensors that could trigger early warning systems about dangerous conditions such as icy roads with valuable real-time data, but analyzing and distributing that data currently requires costly communication between cars and cloud computers. Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) think there’s a better way.

                        “We want cars to communicate with one another – sharing and analyzing information – as well as the cloud, so that they can learn from each other, reducing the expensive bandwidth that comes with contacting the cloud,” said Stacy Patterson, a Rensselaer professor developing the approach with Montana State University researcher Mike P. Wittie, in a new project supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

                        The project, “A Hybrid Vehicle-Cloud Solution for Robust, Cost-Efficient Road Monitoring,” is supported with a two-year $250,000 NSF grant. The research combines the best aspects of existing approaches to big data analytics, which generally fall into two categories: centralized approaches where data is sent to a single location for analysis; and distributed approaches where data analytics is performed by passing messages between participating entities.  Centralized approaches are often simpler, but difficult to scale. Distributed approaches, while scalable, are difficult to analyze and may be disrupted by changes in the network such as loss of network connectivity. 

                        “Our project combines the best of both approaches to get scalability and guaranteed performance,” said Patterson, the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Rensselaer. “This is a hybrid architecture, a new way of performing data analytics that could have applications beyond vehicle networks, such as smart grid design and Internet of Things applications.”

                        Conceptually, the project leverages sensors and networking capabilities already present in new vehicles, and uses connectivity to the cloud to provide a stable backbone when necessary. The proposed system will be designed from the ground up specifically to support data analytics at a low communication cost. The result will be a scalable, agile, cost-efficient solution for real-time, widespread sensing and estimation in vehicle networks.

                        Patterson said the first step in the process is to conduct research confirming that they can use select sensor data to estimate road conditions. To do that, they will equip a small fleet of cars with a custom suite of sensors, gather data, and determine whether their application is capable of accurately estimating actual conditions on the ground using only a portion of that data.

                        “I know we can determine this literal ‘ground truth’ using massive amounts of information. But can we build an application that can estimate this ground truth without measuring every segment of the road and communicate that information to the cloud?” Patterson said. “The benefit of that is that you would need fewer measurements and less bandwidth to make a valuable determination.”

                        After gathering data, the team will build a simulator of their approach, in which they are able to feed in real-world data and simulate cars moving around, sampling the data, and using the algorithm and network to generate information on current road conditions.

                        “You can think of the goal of this project as a prototype, a system where we work out what information needs to be sent to what place and when, and how accurately it’s able to solve the problem,” said Patterson.

                        Patterson is an expert in dynamic networks, distributed algorithms, and cooperative control whose research creates new utility by linking the sensors that pepper modern consumer goods. Her current research is aimed at enhancing the utility of sensors embedded in automobiles, by creating real-time networks that allows automobiles to pool their individual information into a larger shared picture of driving conditions in the area.

                        Her work is an example of The New Polytechnic, a new paradigm for teaching, learning, and research at Rensselaer, the foundation of which is the recognition that global challenges and opportunities are so great that they cannot be addressed by the most talented person working alone. The New Polytechnic enables collaborations between talented people across disciplines, sectors, and global regions, in order to address the complex problems the world.</p>
