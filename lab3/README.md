This is my first attempt on rebuilding a website that someone has already built. And I have to say, it is quite a challenge. Being creative is a must for developing a website, yet I felt constrained because all the necessary elements already exist on the website and I just had to think of different ways to present them. And this just made me realize how much I have to work on web design because I struggled to find a way to make my version of the website visually appealing. I tried different styles but they all turned out against my liking, eventually I settled for a simple design. Some of the biggest problems I encountered include not knowing how to simplify my JS code. I ended up repeating chunks of code that I believe can definitely be simplified. The other was the "I-never-knew-existed" css properties that I spent tons of time researching about. I knew Bootstrap would definitely made this lab much easier but I wanted to get more practice with the fundamentals. Bootstrap, I will eventually pick up because of how much easier it makes things. For my creativity, I think the biggest one was that I didn't make separate web pages for all the info tabs. I was initially going to do that but thought it is too redundant using just vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. So I found out that I can imitate a slide show on my main page using  no other tools, which I thought was really cool. And the other, I'd say is my choice of background pictures. I'm risking the possibility of losing points to put these cute animals on there because I think it is rare that we see animals interact with human's technology. Don't we all love seeing this?
