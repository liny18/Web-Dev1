This lab took me the longest to do out of all. It was definitely worth it not skipping lab 7 because by actually going through that lab helped me a lot in knowing what I can do with MySQL and PHP. In fact, a lot of the code in this lab is directly copy pasta from my lab7. However, I still learned a lot in this lab as there were many things I needed to look up online. I would definitely still consider myself a noob at PHP and MySQL. A lot of my code is spaghetti, but gets the job done. Overall, this was a longgggg lab, but happy ending :DDD
